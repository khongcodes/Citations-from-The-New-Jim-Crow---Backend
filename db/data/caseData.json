    "info": "quoted from the decision: 'For a time, during his service in the penitentiary, he is in a state of penal servitude to the State. He has, as a consequence of his crime, not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords to him. He is for the time being a slave of the State.'",
    "impact": "This decision establishes some historical context behind prisoners' rights problems today - an early, wide understanding became formalized in a section of the canon of law: prisoners are to have no rights."

    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990/89-1690",
    "info": "California police officers saw Charles Acevedo enter an apartment known to contain several packages of marijuana and left a short time later carrying a bag roughly the same size as one of the packages. The officers stopped him and searched his car, searched the bag, and found the marijuana. Acevedo appealed his denied motion to throw out the marijuana as evidence because it was found in a warrant-less search, and the Supreme Court had previously ruled that an officer required a warrant to search a closed container. The Supreme Court upheld a previously ruling allowing officers to thoroughly search a vehicle without warrant if they have probable cause to believe there is evidence in the vehicle.",
    "impact": "Within a few years after Reagan declares the War on Drugs in 1982, the Supreme Court's regard of the Fourth Amendment begins to shift. Justice Stevens, dissenting - 'In the years [from 1982 to 1991], the Court has heard argument in 30 Fourth Amendment cases involving narcotics. ...All save two involved a search or seizure without a warrant or with a defective warrant. And, in all except three, the Court upheld the constitutionality of the search or seizure.'"

    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1967/67",
    "info": "Terry and two men were observed by an officer to be engaging in 'casing' a building. The officer stopped and frisked them, and found weapons on two of them.",
    "impact": "The Court's understanding of the Fourth Amendment shifts further. Stop-and-frisk rule established - 'so long as a police officer has 'reasonable articulable suspicion' that someone is engaged in criminal activity and dangerous' they can stop, question, and frisk them in the absence of probable cause. Judge Douglas dissented, fearing this would open the door to the police being free to conduct warrantless searches on the basis of perceived criminality."

    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1990/89-1717",
    "info": "Terrance Bostick, 28-year-old African American, slept in the back seat of a Greyhound bus on his way from Miami to Atlanta. At a layover in  Fort Lauderdale, two police officers boarded the bus and asked the passengers for permission to search their luggage. Terrance complied, even though he knew his bag held cocaine. The officers had no basis for suspecting Bostick of criminal activity, but they happened to find cocaine; so they arrested Bostick, and he was charged and convicted of trafficking cocaine",
    "impact": "Suspicionless police sweeps of buses in interstate travel became an increasingly common tactic in the War on Drugs. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the police had violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable search (as the police had not allowed the passengers the opportunity to leave the bus to avoid being questioned) and seizure and condemned 'bus sweeps' in general, and they overturned Bostick's conviction - but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision. The Court ruled that Bostick was not 'seized' and that any 'reasonable person' in his circumstance should have felt free to leave and to not consent to the police's request to search their luggage. Prior to this reversal, lower courts had found the notion that 'reasonable people' would feel empowered to refuse to answer to police questioning absurd."

    "title": "Schneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973)",
    "date": "05-29-1973",
    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1972/71-732",
    "info": "A police officer stopped a car with a burned out headlight. There were six men in the car, including Robert Clyde Bustamonte. Only one passenger had a driver's license, and he complied to the officer's request to search the car. The officer found stolen checks, and Bustamonte was arrested and convicted of possessing checks with the intent to defraud. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed on the basis that it must be proven that the person who gave consent to be searched knew that they had the right to refuse consent; but the U.S. Supreme Court held up the original conviction.",
    "impact": "The Supreme Court decided that it was unnecessary to prove that the person who gave consent knew that they had the right to refuse - the Fourth Amendment's protection does not require you to knowingly waive your rights for you to do so, and that if consent had to be given knowingly, it would 'create serious doubt whether consent searches would continue to be conducted'. In other words, consent searches work because people feel unable to refuse consent to the police."

    "title": "Whren v. United States (1996)",
    "date": "06-10-1996",
    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/95-5841",
    "info": "Michael Whren and James Brown, both African American, were stopped by plainclothes officers in an unmarked vehicle in June 1993. The officers admitted they wanted to investigate them for imagined drug crimes, though they did not have probable cause or reasonable suspicion - so they decided to pull them over on the pretext of a traffic violation. On approaching the vehicle, the officers saw Whren holding cocaine in plain view, and arrested the two of them.",
    "impact": "Pretext stops are a very common police tactic where officers pull over vehicles, not motivated by a desire to enforce traffic laws, but by a desire to search for drugs in the absence of any evidence of illegal drug activity. Whren and Brown appealed on the ground that pretextual stops violate the Fourth Amendent - given the multitude of traffic and equipment regulations applicable at any time and the difficulty of obeying them all perfectly at all times, the police will nearly always be able to choose any motorist they may be arbitrarily suspicious any reason, pick a traffic violation as an excuse to pull them over, and perform a cause-less search. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, ruling that officers' state of mind and motivation are irrelevant when evaluating the reasonableness of their activity under the Fourth Amendment; under the Fourth Amendment they may stop motorists and conduct drug investigations regardless of relevant evidence, as long as they have a traffic violation as an excuse."

    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/1996/95-891",
    "info": "Robert Robinette was stopped for speeding. After checking his license, the officer ordered Robinette out of the car, asked him if he was carrying drugs or contraband, and if he would consent to a search. He did, and the officer found a small amount of marijuana and methamphetamine. He was convicted, which the Ohio Supreme Court reversed - they reasoned that the officers should be required to tell the motorists they are free to leave before asking to search their vehicles, in order to give them a chance to refuse consent to be searched. The U.S. Supreme Court held up the original conviction.",
    "impact": "The U.S. Supreme Court held up the original conviction, stating that the Ohio Supreme Court's requirement was 'unrealistic.' In doing so, they helped cement the standard that the police are not required to inform those they stop and search that they can refuse consent to be searched."

    "court": "U.S. Supreme Court",
    "link": "https://www.oyez.org/cases/2000/99-1408",
    "info": "Gail Atwater was driving her truck with her children in the front seat, neither of whom were wearing seatbelts. A misdemeanor in Texas law, an officer pulled her over for these violations, and placed her under arrest and in jail, to be released on bond. She filed suit claiming the officer had violated her Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure, but was denied.",
    "impact": "The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment does not forbid the police from arresting and jailing motorists 'if an officer has probable cause to believe [the motorist] has committed even a very minor criminal offence' (such as a minor traffic violation), even if the violation is punishable in statute only by fine. This means that regardless of whether you give consent to be searched by an officer performing a pretextual traffic stop, the officer has the legal grounds to arrest you."
