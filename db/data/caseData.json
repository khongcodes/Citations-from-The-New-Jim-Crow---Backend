    "info": "quoted from the decision: 'For a time, during his service in the penitentiary, he is in a state of penal servitude to the State. He has, as a consequence of his crime, not only forfeited his liberty, but all his personal rights except those which the law in its humanity accords to him. He is for the time being a slave of the State.'",
    "impact": "This decision establishes some historical context behind prisoners' rights today - an early, wide understanding became formalized in a section of the canon of law: prisoners are to have no rights."
